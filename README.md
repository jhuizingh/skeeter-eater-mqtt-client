Skeeter Eater MQTT Client - An MQTT Client web application

## Get Started

This project was created in Visual Studio Code using node.js and React.

The easiest way to get started is to

1.  Clone it.
2.  Open up the repo's root folder in Visual Studio Code.
3.  Open up a terminal and run `npm install`.
4.  After that finishes, run the command `npm run dev` in the same terminal. This simultaneously starts two web servers; one for the client app and one for the server app.
5.  Alternatively, instead of #4, you can open two terminals and have each run one of the following commands: `npm run client` and `npm run server`.
